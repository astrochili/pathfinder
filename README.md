# Pathfinder

This is example of a pathfinding algoritm on the grid-based map.

Just run in the terminal:
```bash
$ main.lua
```

`generator` generates the map with walls and floors and random free points.

`pathfinder` looks for the best way to pass from the start point to the target point by A-star algoritm.

`display` prints the whole map and the path with full steps list.
